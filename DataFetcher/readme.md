its okay if the requirements.txt is long , sometimes one library uses other stuff as dependencies
therefore one library could bring 10 others
To install the requirements:
pip install -r requirements.txt

then u can launch bookFetcher.py to launch the fecther

The books will be saved in a books folder in tha parent folder of bookFetcher.py
the book_catalogue will be saved in the parent folder too as json file
